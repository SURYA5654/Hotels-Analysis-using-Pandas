# Hotels-Analysis-using-Pandas

I am using a company called Atliq Grands for this project. This company hotel chain, which operates in various cities in India. 
They have hotels in cities Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. They have been in the indusry for around 20 years.

They have different types of hotels such as AtliQ Seasons, AtliQ Exotica, AtliQ Bay, AtliQ Palace. 
For these hotels bookings happens in own website and also in other thirdy pary applications.

I will be performing data analysis with AtliQ Grands database because this company actually facing a major challenge from their competitors.
For that I will pull data from database into jupyter notebook and perform data analysis with pandas.
